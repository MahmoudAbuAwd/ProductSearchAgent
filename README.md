# Trend — lightweight research/agent toolkit

This repository contains Python project that implements an agent-style research/tooling toolkit with both CLI and Web entry points, helper utilities, and sample data.

Repository layout

- `main.py` — project entry point (used in development runs).
- `config.py` — configuration values and settings used across the project.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.
- `app/agent.py` — core agent implementation or business logic.
- `tools/tools.py` — helper utilities used by the agent and UI.
- `UI/CLI.py` — command-line interface to run or interact with the agent.
- `Web.py` — lightweight web interface / server wrapper.
- `data/research_results.json` — example or output data (checked into repo).

Quick start

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the project (development entry):

```powershell
python main.py
```

Alternative entry points

- CLI: `python UI/CLI.py` — run interactive or scripted CLI actions (check the file for supported flags).
- Web: `python Web.py` — starts the web UI (if implemented). The script will print the listening URL.

Configuration

- Edit `config.py` to adjust environment-specific options, API keys, or feature flags.

Data

- The repository includes `data/research_results.json` as a small example output. Large datasets should be kept out of the repo; if you want to track a particular data file, add an explicit allow rule in `.gitignore`.

Development notes

- Keep `requirements.txt` updated when adding packages.
- Use the helpers in `tools/` for shared utilities.
- Add a `scripts/` folder for common developer scripts (setup, seed data, test runs) if needed.

Suggested improvements I can help with

- Add concrete usage examples to this README by summarizing `main.py`, `UI/CLI.py`, and `Web.py` (I can open them and add commands).
- Add unit tests and a GitHub Actions workflow to run them.
- Create a `LICENSE` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Troubleshooting

- If imports fail, ensure your virtual environment is active and dependencies are installed.
- Check `config.py` for placeholder values or missing credentials.

Contact / Contribution

If you'd like, I can update this README further with usage examples or generate a minimal contribution guide. Tell me which entry point you use most (CLI, Web, or `main.py`) and I'll add step-by-step commands.
